# Crud-products


## CRUD APIs

- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete

### Technologies
- ExpressJS Framework (NodeJS Backend)
- Sqlite (Database)

### Intro
Create CRUD Operations on Products 


## Product
- Product ID 
- Name
- Price
- Description


## Sample Data
| product_id | name | price | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | TShirt | 999 | Printed TShirt
| 2 | Airpods | 3000 | Apple Clone Airpods


### SQL Queries
1. Create Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  "product_id"	INTEGER,
	"name"	TEXT,
	"price"	INTEGER,
	"description"	TEXT,
	PRIMARY KEY("product_id" AUTOINCREMENT)
);
```

2. Create Product
```sql
INSERT INTO products (
  name,
  price,
  description
) VALUES (
  "TShirt",
  999,
  "Printed Shirt
)
```

3. Get All Products from the table
```sql
SELECT * from products
```

4. Get Single Product info by product id (example is id `2`)
```sql
SELECT * from products WHERE product_id=2
```

5. Update product based on Product ID (example id is `1`)
```sql
UPDATE products
set
  price=500
WHERE 
  product_id=1
```

6. Delete the product from table based on product id (example id is `4`)
```sql
DELETE from products WHERE product_id=4
```


### Connecting SQLite DB in expressJS
we are using https://github.com/TryGhost/node-sqlite3


Conneting sqlite DB using sqlite3 library by following
```js
const sqlConnector = require('sqlite3').verbose();

const database = new sqlConnector.Database("./path-for-database.db", sqlConnector.OPEN_READWRITE, (error) => {
  if(error) {
    console.log(error)
  }
})
```

Run sql queries for just create, update and delete 
```js
database.exec(SQL_QUERY, (error, success) => {})
```

For Get rows from DB
1. For Single row
```js
database.get(`SELECT * from products WHERE product_id=${2}`, (error, row) => {
  if(error) {
    // show some meaning for message
  } else {
    // use the row value
  }
})
```
2. For Multiple rows
```js
database.all(`SELECT * from products`, (error, rows) => {

})
```


### ExpressJS 
We use expressjs mainly for creating server (mostly handling request and response) 
```js
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const app = express();

// For Handling JSON request body
app.use(bodyParser.json())


// Listen server on any available port
app.listen(3000); 
```

### Handling Request and Response in ExpressJS
```js
// Every route will have a request and accept a response
app.get(ROUTE_FOR_REQUEST, function(request, response) {})

// Another example
const handleMyRequest = function(req, res) {

}
app.get(PATH_FOR_ROUTE, handleMyRequest)

// Request 5 tickets (150) - Each ticket Price is 50
```

### Handling CRUD Operations in any SERVER
- Create (POST)
- Read (GET)
- Update (PUT)
- Delete (DELETE)

### HTTP Methods
| Method | Operation | SQL 
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | Create | INSERT
| GET | Read | SELECT
| PUT | Update | UPDATE
| DELETE | Delete | DELETE

### Define CRUD Operations in ExpressJS Routes
1. Create
```js
function handlePost(req, res) {

}
app.post('/', handlePost)
```

2. Read
```js
const handleGet = (req, res) => {}
app.get('/', handleGet)
```

3. Update
```js
// some-files.js
const handlePut = function(req, res) {

}

module.exports = {
  handlePut: handlePut
}

const methods = require("some-files.js")
app.put('/', methods.handlePut)
```

4. Delete
```js
app.delete('/', (req, res) => {})
```
